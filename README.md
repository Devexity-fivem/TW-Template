# üìù tw_bridge (Formally tw-template)

### üß† About
This was formally tw-template but I decided to change it because it was becoming more of a bridge then a template. All of the core template stuff is still here but just the name changed. If you have issues or suggestions head to my discord or make a issue or suggestion [here](https://github.com/TwisleOfficial/tw_bridge/issues) Also if yall could not do massive PRs. This project intention is for others to use yes but id like to make the majority of it myself thanks for understanding!
